### Adding projects in the repo :
- In order to add your project navigate to `src > components folder > ProjectData.js`

- You'll see some data in the form of key value pairs
  
```js
        {
            "id": <add the corresponding number>,
            "type": <select a type as in Full stack | backend | Web |>,
            "project_name": <Name of your project>,
            "tech_stack": [
               <Add strings which contains the name of any lib or framework>
            ex: "React", "HTML"
            ],
            "description": <This is crucial make sure its short, crisp, and descriptive ideally 1-2 lines>,
